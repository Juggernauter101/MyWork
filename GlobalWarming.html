<p> My question is "What is the scientific data behind climate change and what are the tools used to study it". </p>
<p> These were my answers: <a href="GlobalWarming2.html">1</a> <a href="GlobalWarming3.html">2</a> <a href="GlobalWarming4.html">3</a> <a href="GlobalWarming5.html">4</a> <a href="GlobalWarming6.html">5</a> <a href="GlobalWarming7.html">6</a> <a href="GlobalWarming8.html">7</a> <a href="GlobalWarming9.html">8</a> </p>
